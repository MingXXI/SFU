## Runner distances
## solution to assignment #1
## author: Diana Cukierman

'''
Program brief description:
Two locations are asked to the user (locations are distances to a 0 point).
Tthe first distances is in km,m,cm, the second  in mi,yd,ft
The user is assumed to type correctly
The program  calculates the distance between the two locations,
expressed in different ways
The numbers will be asked one after the other
