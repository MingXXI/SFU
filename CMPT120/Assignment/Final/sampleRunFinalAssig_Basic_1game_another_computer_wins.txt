 Welcome to the "Flipping Dance" game 
 =====================================

 Note: Levels 1, 2 and 3 are implemented;
       You will be able to choose your preferred level for each game;
       The digit/color you choose only affects the totals but not flips

Would  you like to play? (y/n): ==> y

Which level would you like to play?
 1 - Basic, user only,
 2 - Advanced, user and computer, 
 3 - Expert, user and computer: ==> 1

Which digit/color would you like for you?
 0 - white,
 1 - black: ==> 1

Size of board (between 3 and 6 inclusive): ==> 3

The board is
-------------

(initial board)

	     Col 0	Col 1	Col 2	
Row 0		 0	 0	 1
Row 1		 1	 1	 0
Row 2		 0	 1	 0

User, what position are you choosing to flip? (max flips = 3)
(Type  99   for both row and column, if you do not want to do more flips)

row?  (<= 2): 1
col?  (<= 2): 1

The board is
-------------

(after user played (1, 1))

	     Col 0	Col 1	Col 2	
Row 0		 0	 0	 1
Row 1		 1	 0	 0
Row 2		 0	 1	 0

User, what position are you choosing to flip? (max flips = 3)
(Type  99   for both row and column, if you do not want to do more flips)

row?  (<= 2): 99
col?  (<= 2): 99

This game is over because you did not want to flip again!

Rows that have an even number of user digit's (1)

 -  None of the Rows

Cols that have an even number of user digit's (1)

 -  None of the Cols


Sorry!  for you to win, the board had to have at least 
one row and one col with an even number of your digit
but such is nto the case; You had chosen digit 1
Therefore, I, the computer, win this game!
