1. Based on your results for the last question, do you think daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density? Briefly explain why or why not.

	No, base on the figure, there isn't a clear linear relationship between the daily temperatures and city population density. As a specific temperature given, there are several different population density value matches to it, which is a evidence to assume there is no linear relationship. To test the assumption, I used linear regression on the plot but result in a faliure of having associative relationship. 

2. The larger data file (stations.json.gz) was kept compressed throughout the analysis. Constantly decompressing the data seems inefficient. Why might this be faster than working with the uncompressed .json data?
	
	The uncompressed .json data is uncompressed during the python program and it is stored in ram rather than hard drive. Generally, ram has a faster load speed than hard drive where the original compressed file is stored in.
