1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?

	np.sqrt satisfies the assumptions best from all listed methods. 


2. I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

	Original T-test: Is there a difference between number of comments on weekends and weekdays(in canada 2012 & 2013)?
		If the null hypothesis can be rejected, we can conclude at a confident level that the number of comments on weekends and weekdays (in canada in 2012 & 2013) differ.
	Transformed data T-test: Is there a difference between the square root of the number of comments on weekends and weekdays(in canada 2012 & 2013)? 
		If the null hypothesis can be rejected, we can conclude at a confident level that the square roots of the number of comments on weekends and weekdays (in canada in 2012 & 2013) differ.


3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)

	The third does a better job of getting an answer, since after taking the average of each week, the normality and equal-variance conditions for two sample t-test are both satisfied, which lead the p-value more convincing. 
	

4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?

	More Reddit comments are posted in /r/canada on average weekdays.
