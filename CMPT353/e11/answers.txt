1. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere. (No need to time it, unless you really want to.)
	
	I used .cache() after each .groupBy() and the original dataframe. If I hadn't used .cache(), the running time would be longer as the dataframe would be load and calculate everytime when called. 





2. How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?
	
	.broadcast reduce the running time from over 40 second to 30 second around, as .broadcast pass the small size dataframe into every table in advance which reduce the load time.
